    <p>My developing experience is mostly in Ruby on Rails. Typically in that framework you'll work with a SQL type of database, like sqLite, MySql, or Posgres.</p>
    <p>I have other experience in Javascript, within an Express framework. NodeJS on the backend, coupled with Mongo for the DB. For front end i have limited experience with React and Angular. </p>
    <p>Other than those stacks, I have the typical experience with c++, java, android/java, html, css, slim markdown for html and others</p>
