  <p>Hi, my name is Cannon Collins</p>
  <p>I'm a full time software engineer at Verisys in South Jordan. There I work on Ruby on Rails projects, as well as a backend NodeJS app for web scraping.</p>
  <p>I take a class or 2 at BYU each year so that I can someday graduate. A lot of people ask why I want to if I already have a good job. I don't have a good answer other than I just want to finish my degree.</p>
